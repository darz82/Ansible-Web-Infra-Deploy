# Install and deploy Web infrastructure components using Red Hat Ansible

Ansible is a simple agentless automation technology that has caught the world of software configuration management by storm!  Ansible allows IT operators to automate repetitive infrastructure tasks such as installation, configuration and deployment of software using a simple yet powerful automation language *YAML*.  Ansible is an open source project and is the core automation engine powering Red Hat Ansible Tower.  Ansible provides close to 800+ (at the time of this writing) pre-built modules that can be used to automate complex infrastructure tasks ranging from web/application deployment to configuration management to workflow orchestration.

**Important Note:** This project assumes readers are familiar with writing simple Ansible automation scripts using the YAML language and/or have prior experience working with IT infrastructure automation tools such as Chef and Puppet.
